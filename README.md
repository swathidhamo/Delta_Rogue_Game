# Rogue_Game
This repository consists of a minimal clone of the dungeon crawler game. This is a purely frontend based game involving the use of no gaming libraries or frameworks as such, so I have used HTML, CSS and Js

## Game outline

  - The rogue game involves navigating a player through a series of obstacles with enemies
  - There are multiple levels and entry to the next level is only possible upon reaching the exit door where you will go to the next level
  - Both the enemies and you will have a gun and pressing spacebar will help you shoot 
  - You have to reach the final level within a stipulated number of lives
  - There are treasures along the way and power ups like a speed up or an additional life
